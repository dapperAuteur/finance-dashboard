This account is used most often. It's used for daily purchases of fuel for BAM and his vehicles. BAM has two types of accounts with this institution **Personal** and **Business**. The difference is with the **owner of the account** and to **whom's benefit** it is used.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendering HTML is the _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generatkion for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
