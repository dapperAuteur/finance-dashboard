This account is rarely used. It's mainly used as a savings account. BAM has two accounts here: **checking** and **savings**.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendering HTML is the _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generatkion for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
